## Community Bonding Period wrap-up

It has been 2 weeks since the Coding Period has officially started. As I mentioned in the previous [post](_posts/2020-05-31-end_of_bonding_period.md), I had started with some functions from NumPy's [lib/function_base](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/lib/function_base.py) set. And finally, review for performance testing and documentation is done and the following functions are now supported in CuPy  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

```ruby
    cupy.piecewise()
```
   *  `cupy.ElementwiseKernel` is used to parallelize the operations for scalar functions which boosts the speedup considerably in comparison to NumPy's

```ruby
   cupy.trim_zeros()
```
   * The familiar sequential approach for trimming a sequence is known for the poor performance specially when the number of leading/trailing zeros is large.
   * The mapping reduction scheme offered by CUDA kernels in CuPy (a.k.a`cupy.ReductionKernel`) accelerated the trimming operation immensely as was shown in the benchmark

```ruby
    cupy.sort_complex()
```
   * It is build on `cupy.sort()` with complex data types support

## Coding Period: Week 2 progress

The core of my project involves polynnomial support for CuPy. This comes with some functions prerequisites that need to be implemented first.
I initiated PRs for the following ones:
```ruby
cupy.convolve()
cupy.correlate()
cupy.polynomial.polynomial.polyvander()
cupy.polynomial.polynomial.polycompanion()
cupy.polynomial.polyutils.as_series()
cupy.polynomial.polyutils.trimseq()

```
1. `cupy.convolve()` and `cupy.correlate()` still need some inspection in handling number of threads per block/ number of blocks per grid when dealing with CUDA dynamic parallelism
2. `cupy.polynomial.polynomial.polyvander()` is still in progress while comparing various approaches to minimize computations time.
3. `cupy.polynomial.polynomial.polycompanion()`: Test coverage enhancement and documentation are still under review

Overall, it is a great experience where I am discovering new aspects to NumPy and CUDA.
